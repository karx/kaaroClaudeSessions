# Sonic Mapping — Design Guide

How to attack the audio design layer once adapter coverage is solid.

**Current state (2026-06-10):** All event types are wired end-to-end
(`adapter → NR → transformer → resolveSonic → audio`). The question is no longer
"does this fire?" but "does it sound right?" This doc is the roadmap for that work.

## Current Sonic Profile (what we have)

Each column comes from `lib/event-types.mjs`. These are the *defaults* — presets
override via `mappings[]` rules.

| `unknown` | META | tick | 0.00 | 0.25 | 3000 | 0 | Catch-all |

### Brightness encoding (special rule for `tokens`)

`tokens` brightness is not fixed — `resolveSonic` overrides it based on cache ratio:

```
cacheRatio = cache_read / (output + cache_read)
brightness = lerp(5000, 800, cacheRatio)
```

Low brightness (≈800) = warm, cached context. High brightness (≈5000) = fresh tokens.
This is the only event type with dynamic brightness.

## Open Design Problems

### 1. `mode_shift` — chime is correct but pitch is random

Currently `mode_shift` gets a pitch from `path_hash(null)` → always the same note.
The intent (W-COG-03) is to *signal a mode change*, not just fire once per session.

**Two approaches:**

**A. Octave ladder** — plan mode = oct+1, back to normal = oct-1. Very legible.
```js
// In resolveSonic, after base sonic:
if (event === 'mode_shift') {
  sonic.octave = data.mode === 'plan' ? 1 : data.mode === 'normal' ? 0 : -1;
}
```
Requires `data.mode` on the pulse (already present from transformer).

**B. Scale shift** — plan mode switches the SCALE from `major_pentatonic` to `dorian`.
Much more dramatic; requires threading a mutable scale state through `simulateSession`.
Hard to implement without side effects.

**Recommendation:** Option A first. Simple, reversible, testable.

---

### 2. `attachment` — all subtypes sound identical

`attachment` events carry `data.subtype`. The current `click` instrument is correct
but every subtype (file, task_reminder, invoked_skills, plan_mode) hits the same note.

**Subtype → octave map (proposed):**

| Subtype | Intent | Proposed octave |
|---|---|---|
| `file` | File context loaded | 0 |
| `task_reminder` | Task list injected | +1 |
| `invoked_skills` | Skills loaded | +1 |
| `plan_mode` / `plan_mode_exit` | Plan mode entered/exited | +2 / −1 |
| `deferred_tools_delta` | Tool list updated | 0 |
| `skill_listing` | Skill catalog | −1 |
| `compact_file_reference` | Post-compact context | −1 |
| everything else | Default | 0 |

Implementation: in `resolveSonic`, after base sonic lookup, adjust `octave` if
`event === 'attachment'` and `data.subtype` is known.

---

### 3. `tokens` — brightness dynamic, but volume is flat

The cache ratio already drives brightness. Volume should scale with the *size* of
the turn — heavier model work = louder flute.

**Proposed:** `volMult = lerp(0.30, 0.90, outputTokens / MAX_OUTPUT)` where
`MAX_OUTPUT = 8192` (typical max context output). Clamp at 0.90 to avoid clipping.

Implementation site: `resolveSonic` tokens branch, after cache-ratio brightness.

---

### 4. `tool_result` — success sounds like `read` (both are harp)

`tool_result` and `read` share the same instrument. The semantic difference is:
- `read` = active action (the AI chose to read)
- `tool_result` = passive receipt (the environment responded)

**Proposed:** use a lower-velocity harp (reduce `volMult` to 0.25), or switch to
`woodblock` at oct−1 to push it into the "structural" family sonically.

---

### 5. `human_turn` — pad volume does not scale with prompt length

W-COG-01 asked for amplitude to scale with prompt character count.

**Implementation:** In the transformer, add `char_count: nr.text?.length || 0` to the
`human_turn` pulse data. In `resolveSonic`:
```js
if (event === 'human_turn') {
  const chars = data.char_count || 0;
  sonic.volMult = Math.min(1.20, 0.50 + (chars / 500) * 0.70);
}
```
Cap at 1.20. A 500-char prompt = full volume. Single word = 0.50.

---

### 6. `unknown` — reduced from 1600+ to ~4 real unknowns per CC session ✓

**Resolved (2026-06-10).** The bulk of unknowns came from:

| Source | Count (approx) | Resolution |
|---|---|---|
| `branch_change` dedup (was emitting on every user record) | ~400 | CC adapter now deduplicates — only emits on actual change |
| `assistant_turn` NR (structural wrapper) | ~350 | Pulse `silent` (`reason: envelope`) — 2026-08-26 |
| `content_block/tool_use` (pre-tool marker) | ~350 | Pulse `silent` (`reason: duplicate`) |
| `content_block/thinking` | ~110 | Mapped to `thinking` event type (soft pad) |
| `session_meta` / `branch_change` / `skill_invoke` | ~230 | Pulse `silent` (`reason: snapshot`) |
| Actual `unknown_record` (unrecognized types) | ~4 | Left as `unknown` tick — diagnostic signal |

The remaining audible unknowns (`unknown_record` from unrecognized JSONL types) are
intentional — they surface coverage gaps and are useful for debugging.

Disposition is the table in `hooks/pulse-map.mjs`, not preset `nr_kind` off-rules. `ruleMatches` still supports `nr_kind` for real profile overrides.

### 7. W-COG-07 — Content-aware pitching

Not yet implemented. Requires new data from adapters.

**For file writes/edits:** the Edit tool's `new_string` / `old_string` gives us a line-delta.
If `new_string.split('\n').length > old_string.split('\n').length`, pitch up (ascending);
if fewer lines, pitch down (descending). For Write with a large file, always ascending.

Implementation sites:
1. CC adapter: add `line_delta` to `tool_use` NR input: `new_string.split('\n').length - old_string.split('\n').length`
2. Transformer: pass `line_delta` through on `tool_call` pulse data
3. `resolveSonic`: for `key === 'edit'`, adjust `octave` by `Math.sign(data.line_delta)`

**For web:** `WebFetch` already maps to `web` → bell at oct+1. Could differentiate
`WebSearch` (broader, louder) from `WebFetch` (precise, quieter) via a `web_type` field.

## Implementation Order

### Quick wins (1–2 hours each)

1. **`mode_shift` octave-by-mode** — 5 lines in `resolveSonic`, 1 test
2. **`attachment` octave-by-subtype** — 10 lines in `resolveSonic`, 1 test  
3. **`human_turn` volume-by-length** — 5 lines in transformer + resolveSonic, 1 test
4. ~~**Silence structural unknowns in presets**~~ ✓ Done (2026-06-10)
5. ~~**`branch_change` dedup in CC adapter**~~ ✓ Done (2026-06-10)
6. ~~**`thinking` event type**~~ ✓ Done (2026-06-10)

### Medium (half day)

7. **`tokens` volume-by-size** — new field in transformer, 5 lines in resolveSonic
8. ~~**`ruleMatches` nr_kind support**~~ ✓ Done (2026-06-10)

### Larger effort (1–2 days)

7. **W-COG-07 line-delta pitching** — adapter change + transformer + resolveSonic + 3 tests
8. **Scale-shift for plan mode** — requires threading scale state through `simulateSession`

## Where to make changes

| Change | File | Function |
|---|---|---|
| Add dynamic sonic per event | `lib/audio-sim.mjs` | `resolveSonic()` |
| Expose new data fields | `lib/pulse-transformer.mjs` | `transformRecord()` |
| Add new data from raw records | `adapters/<harness>.mjs` | `recordsToNormalized()` |
| Silence specific NR subtypes | `lib/audio-presets.mjs` | per-preset `mappings[]` |
| New default sonic profile | `lib/event-types.mjs` | `EVENT_TYPES` entry |

The architecture enforces the boundary: adapters are sonic-unaware. All sonic
decisions live in `resolveSonic()` and presets. Don't put audio logic in adapters.
